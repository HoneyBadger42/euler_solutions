Solutions to Euler Problems.

After solving a hundred problems,
I wanted to share my methods, before going on solving the other problems.
with short and efficient algorithms, written in C.

When I solved the problems,
I saved so dev time, by coding in Bash, Python, or Scala,
but I really love low level,
above all, I love C programing !

The C programs I share, are short, fast and portable !

I hope some of them will be useful !
